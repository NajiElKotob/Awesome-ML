# Acronyms and Definitions

* **Supervised machine learning** is ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data
* **Label** is a variable we are predicting, typically represented by the variable 'y'
* **Features** are input variables describing the data, typically represented by the variables {x1, x2, x3,..., xn}
* **Example** is a particular instance of data, x
* **Labeled example** has {features, label}:(x,y), used to train the model
* **Unlabeled example** has {features, ?}:(x,?), used for making prediction on new data
* **Model** maps examples to predicted labels: y', defined by internal parameters, which are learned
